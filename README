Ircxom is an IRC bot that allows people to write and manage posts in a
Blosxom blog.  Posts are organized by network and channel.  Chat-based
communities can use it to record oral history.  It's a little more
private and centralized than twitter, and the messages can be
substantially larger.

Originally hacked together around March 2003.
